# Yucando Documentation

Yucando is a gamified social task management platform.

Completing tasks is gamified through a medieval village setting where you and your friend settle an island in the archipelago of Yucan. Completing tasks awards users with resources which they can use to trade and build your village.

Yucando is currently in development and hosted on [yucando.it].
