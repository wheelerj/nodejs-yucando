<h1>About Yucando</h1>

<p>Yucando.it is an online cloud task management system that lets you encourage your friends</p>

<p>
  Yucando offers a robust API for storing and accessing tasks as JSON documents.
  The philosophy is to allow the end user greater flexibility with their data,
  so that their workflow is not determined by their system, but their system is
  tailored to their workflow.
</p>

<p>
  Yucando also offers a social element, where you can choose who sees what. You
  can share your todo list with a loved one, or show your advisor what you have
  on your academic plate. You can monitor progress in a friend's project and offer
  support when they are stuck. In short, allowing people to come together where
  day to day "busyness" divides.
